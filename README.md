# :video_game: The OSGD Collection
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/82ea60cf-6767-463f-8481-876ae04f7a9c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/romantic-darwin-6a07eb/deploys)

The **Open Source Game Development (OSGD) Collection** is a curated list of freely available open-source game development resources that anyone can access. The purpose of the list is to serve as a central repository of open-source game development projects for anyone to discover, use, or contribute to.

It can be accessed through: [opensourcegamedev.com](https://opensourcegamedev.com)

The list is maintained by [Kiptoke](https://github.com/Kiptoke), who can also be found on Twitter as [@KiptokeDev](https://twitter.com/KiptokeDev).

## Contributing to the OSGD
### Changes to the OSGD List

Want to add, remove, or change an entry in the OSGD list? Then please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/Kiptoke/OSGD-Collection/issues/new/choose) in order to do so! Note that all proposed changes to the OSGD are subject to review before being accepted.

If you're interested in adding an entry into the OSGD, be sure to help me by placing the project into one of these 6 categories:
- Game Engine
- Code
- Art
- Audio
- Design
- Games

Additionally, make sure that the project meets the OSGD requirements:

- The project must be freely available to build and modify - having standalone paid version (like Aseprite) is fine, as long as people can freely access the repository and build their own verion.
- The project cannot directly be involved with cryptocurrency and/or NFTs.
- The project's code must be hosted on GitHub.

### Changes to the Website

Want to suggest a cool new feature or even help me develop the OSGD site? Feel free to take a look at the [issues page](https://github.com/Kiptoke/OSGD-Collection/issues). There, you can either take on a proposed change to the website under the ENHANCEMENTS tag, or propose a change of your own! If you need an idea of how you can help improve the site, please take a look at the *What's Next* section in the [about page](https://opensourcegamedev.com/public/about.html).
