# OSGD Collection

The **Open Source Game Development (OSGD) Collection** is a curated list of freely available open-source game development resources that anyone can access. The purpose of the list is to serve as a central repository of open-source game development projects for anyone to discover, use, or contribute to.

It is currently in development.

The list is maintained by [Kiptoke](https://github.com/Kiptoke), who can also be found on Twitter as [@KiptokeDev](https://twitter.com/KiptokeDev).
